            <h1>Lana Del Ray</h1>
            <p>Lana Del Ray is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey.[1][2] The album was
                released by 5 Points Records on January 4, 2010 via the United States Amazon MP3 and iTunes Stores. The
                record was eventually pulled from retailers soon afterwards because, according to Del Rey, the label was
                unable to fund it.</p>
