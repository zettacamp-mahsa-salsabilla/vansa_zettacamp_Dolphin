                Hi, my name is <span style="color: darkred;font-weight:bold" class="a">Mahsa Vania Salsabilla</span>.
                You can call
                me <span style="color:darkred;font-weight:bold">Vansa</span>.
                and i'm very interest to learn about <i><b class="b">Software Testing.</b></i>
                </br>
                Actually, I just found out that there was a software testing lesson when I continued my studies at the
                undergraduate level.
                </br>From there I was interested to deepen the lesson.
                </br>I am a very passionate person, like to learn all new things, and always want to try to keep
                learning.
                </br>
                </br>
                Since childhood, I was trained to be <b class="a">disciplined, responsible, reliable and committed.</b>
                </br>My parents were disciplined people, every day was like <strong class="b">military
                    training</strong>. but
                that's what made me a tough and strong person.
                <br>
                <code><b>In short, I can describe that when I run and I'm tired, I prefer to keep going rather than stop. That's me!</b></code>
