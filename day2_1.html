            <blockquote>
                Hi, my name is <span style="color: darkred;font-weight:bold">Mahsa Vania Salsabilla</span>. You can call
                me <span style="color:darkred;font-weight:bold">Vansa</span>.
                and i'm very interest to learn about <i><b>Software Testing.</b></i>
                </br>
                Actually, I just found out that there was a software testing lesson when I continued my studies at the
                undergraduate level.
                </br>From there I was interested to deepen the lesson.
                </br>I am a very passionate person, like to learn all new things, and always want to try to keep
                learning.
                </br>
                </br>
                Since childhood, I was trained to be <b>disciplined, responsible, reliable and committed.</b>
                </br>My parents were disciplined people, every day was like <strong>military training</strong>. but
                that's what made me a tough and strong person.
                </br>
                </br>
                <code><b>In short, I can describe that when I run and I'm tired, I prefer to keep going rather than stop. That's me!</b></code>

            <h3>What is my hobby?</h3>
            <blockquote>
                Fun fact, the name <span style="color:darkred;font-weight:bold">Vansa</span> is my pen name
                &lt;<b>Vansabil</b>&gt;.
                </br>Which means that my hobby used to be <u>writing</u>, mostly I wrote stories with poetic words, I
                like to listen to various <u>instrumental music</u>, yes.. only the instrumental.
                </br>I like to go for a walk to see <u>nature</u>, I really like to see the <u>beauty of nature</u>.
                </br>
                </br>
                I don't really have a hobby in the IT field, right? At first I only pursued this field because I was
                still in college.
                </br>but I didn't expect that I slowly liked it.
