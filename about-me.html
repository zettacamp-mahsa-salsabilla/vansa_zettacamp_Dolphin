                Hi, this is <span style="color: darkred;font-weight:bold">Vansa Make Up</span>. This is company is <span style="color:darkred;font-weight:bold">available Multiple Make Up</span>.
                Polite Society is the second brand to launch from <i><b>Vansa Brands.</b></i>

                Blandino and Johnson's new company headquartered in Orange County. The first was Diamond Drunk, a prestige line of non-toxic plant-derived, scented jewelry cleaners in luxurious packaging that launched last month. 
                </br>ust like Too Faced, Polite Society will be fueled by Jerrod’s legendary creative vision and Jeremy’s strategic business know-how.
                </br>The partners—in business and in life—met in 1995 while working behind the cosmetics counters of Estée Lauder and Chanel, respectively. Too Faced was "born" two years later. 
                </br>
                </br>
                The duo sold Too Faced to The Estee Lauder Companies</b>
                </br>in 2016 for a record-breaking $1.45 billion, and then<strong> stepped down from the company</strong>. last year.

                We can't wait to see more of.  <span style="color:darkred;font-weight:bold">Polite Society's</span>packaging. We caught a glimpse of pastel-hues and shiny rose gold accents, although the packaging differs from Too Faced in that it is less embellished.

            </br>Clean skincare-meets-makeup hybrid formulas will be its signature. The brand's "No" list is posted on Instagram, and in the photo above.
        </br> "Banned" ingredients include parabens, phthalates, talc, mineral oils—and more. 
    </br>But natural formulas won't mean sheer coverage or a "no makeup" look.
</br>We expect high-pigment colors and glamour, which represents a new direction for clean beauty.
