                    <td style="text-align : center;" width="350";><b>Lana Del Ray</b> is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey.[1][2] The album was released by 5 Points Records on January 4, 2010 via the United States Amazon MP3 and iTunes Stores. The record was eventually pulled from retailers soon afterwards because, according to Del Rey, the label was unable to fund it.[2] Del Rey ultimately bought back the rights to the album. After the release of her major-label debut, Born to Die (2012), under her stage name Lana Del Rey, she expressed her wish to re-release the album, though this never ended up happening.[2] The album was never released physically, aside from the many bootleg vinyl pressings, CDs and cassette tapes.</td>
